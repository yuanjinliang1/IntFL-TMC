This project is developed by the co-author of the paper "Mandheling: Mixed-Precision On-Device DNN Training with DSP Offloading​". 
We have consolidated and open-sourced the code used in our research to accurately measure the ​time consumption and energy usage​ of neural network training processes on terminal devices (e.g., smartphones, embedded devices). 
The goal is to provide the community with a reliable benchmarking tool to facilitate efficient deep learning research in edge computing environments.

​For detailed experimental results and analysis, please refer to our MOBICOM 2023 paper and the avaliable code is as following.​​
